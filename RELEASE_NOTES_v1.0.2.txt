High-performance Random Forest implementation with GPU acceleration, advanced interpretability, and proximity-based analysis. Faithful to Breiman & Cutler's original methodology.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- Complete classification with out-of-bag error estimation and confusion matrices
- Proximity matrices for outlier detection, clustering, and visualization
- Local importance (per-sample feature importance)
- Interactive visualization with rfviz (3D MDS, parallel coordinates)

### Performance Enhancements
- Full GPU acceleration (CUDA) for trees, importance, and proximity computation
- QLORA compression: 12,500× memory reduction for proximity matrices
- CPU TriBlock: 2.7× memory savings with lossless quality
- Scales to 1M+ samples (vs ~60K limit in traditional implementations)

## Installation

GPU Version:
```
pip install rfx-ml==1.0.2
